# Jumbo Geo Application

## Overview

Jumbo Geo Application is a Spring Boot application designed to manage stores and their locations using MongoDB as the database. It provides a REST API to retrieve the nearest stores based on geographic coordinates.

---

## Features

- **MongoDB Integration**: Connects to MongoDB to store and query store locations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured to limit API requests using `bucket4j`.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Provides API documentation through Swagger UI.
- **Logging**: Added SLF4J-based logging for better observability.
- **Spring Security**: Secures endpoints and allows fine-grained access control.
- **Actuator**: Exposes health check and application metrics.
- **Java 21 Compatibility**: Upgraded to leverage the latest Java features.
- **DTOs and Interfaces**: Implements clean code practices using DTOs and interfaces.

    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. **Check Application Status**:
    Visit the following link in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
    ```

4. **Access Swagger Documentation**:
    Visit the following link in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
    ```

5. **Test the API**:
    Fetch the nearest stores:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nearest-stores?latitude=52.37867&longitude=4.883832
    ```
